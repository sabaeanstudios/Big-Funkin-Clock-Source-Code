:hapy:Good news, because of our time together you gave me an idea for a far better concept that exceeds even CODE:rat 5
:hapy:with the inspiration by you drastically changing my emotions through a singing battle
:bf:beep
:meh:I've realised my mistakes writing the CODE:rat saga and now I have decided a reboot is far more necessary
:sad:But there's just one problem
:sad:it lacks the essence of a marketable ending 
:meh:Listen bluey, i'm guessing you want to go back to earth right? I'll get you back there in the most fastest way possible
:meh:IF you do one more song with me, I need that inspiration for the ending
:meh:Deal?
:bf:bibibibabababobobosesese
:hapy:I'll take that as a yes, let me go get something
:mic:Used to do karaoke back then, I knew this would come in handy
:mic:Now then, are you ready er, 
:mic:what's your actual name?
:bf:beep bo, be ba de boop
:mic:Okay, that, lets do this final song now
:bf:bap
